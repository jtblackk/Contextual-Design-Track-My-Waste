# Contextual Design: Track My Waste
Track My Waste is an app that nudges users into living more sustainable lifestyles, on the individual level and the community level.

In this folder are all of the documents that came out of the contextual design process for the app. Mostly just reports of user research, brainstorming sessions, and design sessions.

The first document covers the process of analyzing the current market. We looked for similar application ideas to Track My Waste -- analysis focused on the usability of similar applications to our idea of Track My Waste. We conducted and documented interviews with target demographics to build up a cohesive picture of our users' lives--analysis focused on building up a solid understanding of the context for which we were building the application.

The second document reports the process of ideation for Track My Waste--moving from models of people's lives to a vision of the tasks that our end-product hopes to support, product concepts that support the visioned tasks, and fictitious personas and scenarios that entail the use of our end-product. All of the models that resulted from ideation are presented and discussed in this document.

The third document covers the process of interaction analysis and design. We created storyboards, GTNs(Generalized Transition Networks), and wireframes to aid in the process of moving from user research and design conceptualization to planning out and wireframing a full application, and they are all included in the document.

The fourth Document just documents the process I went through for critiquing some of my peers' design for an app. It's primarily a collection of Usability Aspect Reports that provide critiques of application usability guided by Nielson's usability heuristics. All of the UARs are included in the document.

The fifth document reports the process of critiquing the design of our app. The process entailed prototyping our app, creating tests for usability testers, running think-aloud tests to gauge the usability of our app, and making final changes to our app prototype. Along with documenting this process, we describe the problems that users encountered and reflect on the design critique process as a whole.
